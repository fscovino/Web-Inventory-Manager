# WEB INVENTORY MANAGER

This application was designed to be able to assign different categories to products in a long list of inventory. It allows the user to copy attributes on selected items and then paste them to another group of items. This is a process that could be done on Excell but would take much more time. With this application the process is more intuitive.
